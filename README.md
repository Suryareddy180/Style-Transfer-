# Style-Transfer-
This project applies artistic style transfer to each frame of a video using a style image, powered by TensorFlow Hub's Magenta model. It processes videos frame-by-frame with OpenCV and saves the output as a stylized .mp4 file, allowing users to create creative, AI-enhanced video content.
