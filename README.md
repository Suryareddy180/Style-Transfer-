# ðŸŽ¨ STYLE TRANSFER USING PRE-TRAINED MODEL ðŸŽ¬

This project applies **artistic style transfer** to videos using TensorFlow Hub's **Magenta style transfer model**, enhanced with **sharpening filters**, **frame upscaling**, and **original audio retention**. It processes videos frame-by-frame using OpenCV and TensorFlow, resulting in a **visually stunning and AI-enhanced output video**.

---

## ðŸš€ Features

- ðŸŽ¨ **Style Transfer**: Applies the visual style of any image to each frame of a video.
- ðŸ“ˆ **Super High Visual Clarity**: Uses 512x512 frame processing, sharpening filters, and optional super-resolution.
- ðŸ”Š **Audio Preservation**: Retains the original audio using MoviePy.
- âš¡ **Efficient Frame-by-Frame Processing**: Combines the power of TensorFlow, OpenCV, and NumPy.
- ðŸ“¦ **Export in High Bitrate**: Ensures crisp quality output using `libx264` codec at 5000 kbps.

---

## ðŸ“¦ Dependencies

Install required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install tensorflow tensorflow_hub opencv-python moviepy numpy
```

## ðŸ§  How It Works
- Loads the TensorFlow Hub model: magenta/arbitrary-image-stylization-v1-256.
- Resizes each frame to 512x512 and applies style transfer.
- Applies advanced sharpening filters for enhanced clarity.
- Reconstructs the video in original resolution and re-attaches the original audio.

## ðŸ§ª Example Usage
``` bash
input_video_path = '/content/stock3.mp4'
style_image_path = '/content/scene9.jpg'
output_video_path = '/content/output_super_high_quality.mp4'

style_transfer_video(input_video_path, style_image_path, output_video_path)
```
## ðŸŽ¯ Output
- Format: .mp4

- Codec: libx264

- Audio: Original input audio preserved

- Bitrate: 5000 kbps (for better visual quality)
